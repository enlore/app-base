## Exloring the ecosystem in pursuit of a standard set of tools

Starting a frontend project needs to be a snap. Need a few things:

- [x] Reset sheet
- [x] Feature detection
- [x] Markup boilerplate
- [ ] Iconography placeholders (for mobile icons, favicon)
- [ ] Static assets
- [ ] Grid System (float, flex)
- [ ] Progressive build system (starting with 'none')
- [ ] spah framework for spahs

### Static boilerplates

* Normalize
* H5BP
* Modernizr

### Candidates for CSS tooling

* Jeet (love stylus)
* Susy (but Susy seems way more flexible and better documented)
* :sparkles: Skeleton (great for clean, simple float grid)
* :sparkles: Milligram (great for flex)
* PostCSS (grid and utility mixins available?)
* ~~Pure~~
* ~~Kouto Swiss~~
* ~~Nib~~ (out of date on simple things like Normalize)

### Spuh Framework/Lib

:sparkles: Vue.js. Gotta say I'm a fan.
